Resources list for P2 FEWD 2015 Cohort 2



This was all new to me.  I have practically zero background in programming.  I spent some time back in 1999
 
playing with HTML and selecting "view source" code to learn a few HTML tags like <br>, , <a = href, bold and italic.



For the first project 1 I finished the video lessons and then spent a ton of time in the forums writing and re-writing

the HTML code.  Once I figured out the CSS tweaks were the key to getting my mockup page to get more in line

I retuned my CSS and finished the project.  Then I validated CSS and HTML, met with my instructor 
Jee Kang 
and submitted my project when she gave me the go ahead.   



I was convinced everyone else was way ahead of me since some people were on P3 and P4 and I was still on P1.

But I believe some people are only working on the nanodegree and don't work 50 hour a week full time jobs 

while trying to make time to study too like I have to. I try to stay positive!



For P2 i started out on Git and figured out basic navigation without having to take the entire course.

I registered my github and completed the Javascript Basics and Intro to JQuery courses.

I found most of the items very confusing and there were missing parts in the videos to the solutions

James and Cameron were arriving at at the end of the lession.  Several times they listed a typo or problem

with their code in the solution.  I reported a couple of issues as well like my finding ".splice" instead

of.slice in the first .replace quiz.  Its a different command altogether!
